# Single-Cycle-RiscV-Architecture

RISC-V Single-Cycle Processor with CSR

This project showcases the implementation of a RISC-V processor using a single-cycle architecture. Each instruction is executed in a single clock cycle, and the design incorporates Control and Status Registers (CSR) for effective system-level control and exception handling. The CSR trap mechanism is hard-wired to manage exceptions seamlessly.
